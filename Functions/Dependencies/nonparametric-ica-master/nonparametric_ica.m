% 
% Performs the nonparametric decomposition described in:
% 
% Norman-Haignere SV, Kanwisher NG, McDermott JH (2015). Distinct cortical pathways for music and
% speech revealed by hypothesis-free voxel decomposition. Neuron.
% 
% The algorithm iteratively rotates the top K principal components of the data matrix, X, to
% maximize a measure of non-Gaussianity ('negentropy'). This procedure is closely related to
% standard algorithms for independent component analysis, but unlike standard algorithms does not
% depend on assumptions about the type of non-Gaussian distribution being identified. Because
% negentropy is estimated with a histogram, the algorithm tends to work well with a large number of
% data points (~10,000). The run-time of the algorithm increases substantially as the number of
% components is increased because the optimization is performed via a brute-force search over all
% pairs of components (run-time is thus proportional nchoosek(K,2) where K is the number of
% components).
% 
% Most of the computations are performed by the helper function maximize_negentropy_via_rotation. 
% 
% Entropy is estimated using a script from Rudy Moddemeijer.

% -- Required Input Arguments --
% 
% X: [M x N] data matrix containing N measurements/data-points and M features. In the Neuron paper,
% N corresponded to the the number of voxels (11,065 across all 10 subjects) and M to the number of
% sounds tested (165).
% 
% K: The number of components to be inferred. Six components were used to model the voxel responses
% measured in the Neuron paper. 
% 
% -- Optional Input Arguments --
% 
% N_RANDOM_INITS: A single run of the algorithm is only gauranteed to find a local optima. But the
% algorithm can be run many times from random starting points (random rotations of the principal
% components), and the best answer across the different random initializations will be returned
% (default: 10).
%
% PLOT_FIGURES: Whether or not to plot figures potentially useful measures of negentropy (default: false).
% 
% RAND_SEED: Seed to initialize the random stream with. Fixing the random seed can be useful so that
% the algorithm always returns the same answer for a given input (default: 1).
% 
% -- Output --
% 
% R: [M x K] response profile matrix containing the response of each of the K components to each of
% the M stimulus features. This matrix was use to investigate the functional properties of the
% components described in the neuron paper.
% 
% W: [K x N] weight matrix containing the weight of each of the K components to each of the N
% measurements/data-points. This matrix contained the voxel weights for the componenst described in
% the Neuron paper, and was used to investigate their anatomical properties.
%
